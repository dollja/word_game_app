# **Word Association Game**

## **Overview**
The Word Association Game is a multiplayer online game where players take turns submitting words that are logically associated with the previous word. The game uses OpenAI's GPT model to validate word associations and ensure fair gameplay. 

### **Game Rules**
1. Players must enter a valid OpenAI API key to start.
2. The game begins with an initial word generated by the AI.
3. Each player submits a word that is logically associated with the previous word.
4. The AI validates word associations before accepting the new word.
5. Players earn **10 points** for each valid word submission.
6. The game continues indefinitely until players decide to stop.

## **Folder Structure**
The application is organized into a **backend** and **frontend** structure:

```
word_game_app/
│── backend/                 # Server-side code
│   ├── server.js            # Express.js and Socket.IO backend
│   ├── package.json         # Backend dependencies
│── frontend/                # Client-side code
│   ├── index.html           # Main game interface
│── README.md                # Documentation
```

## **Dependencies**
### **Backend (Node.js)**
- `express` - Web framework for handling API requests.
- `socket.io` - Enables real-time multiplayer communication.
- `body-parser` - Parses incoming API requests.
- `node-fetch` - Fetches data from OpenAI's API.

### **Frontend**
- **TailwindCSS** - For UI styling.
- **Socket.IO Client** - For real-time updates.

## **Installation and Running the App Locally**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-game-app.git
cd word-game-app
```

### **2. Install Backend Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### **3. Start the Backend Server**
```bash
npm start
```

### **4. Serve the Frontend**
Use a static server like `http-server`:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npx http-server
```

### **5. Open the Game**
Visit the provided URL from `http-server` in your browser.

---

## **Deployment Guide**
### **1. Deploy Backend to a Cloud Service**
- **Heroku Deployment**:
  ```bash
  heroku create word-game-server
  git push heroku main
  ```

- **AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean**:
  ```bash
  npm install pm2 -g
  pm2 start server.js
  ```

### **2. Host the Frontend**
- Use **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages** to deploy `index.html`.
- Example with Vercel:
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  cd frontend
  vercel deploy
  ```

---

## **Final Notes**
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is **kept private** and not hardcoded in the frontend.
- For persistent game states, consider integrating a database like Firebase or MongoDB.
- If deploying on a shared server, use **HTTPS** and environment variables for security.
