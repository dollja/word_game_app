# **Word Association Game**

## **Overview**
The Word Association Game is a multiplayer online game where players take turns submitting words that are logically associated with the previous word. The game uses OpenAI's GPT model to validate word associations and ensure fair gameplay. 

### **Game Rules**
1. Players must enter a valid OpenAI API key to start.
2. The game begins with an initial word generated by the AI.
3. Each player submits a word that is logically associated with the previous word.
4. The AI validates word associations before accepting the new word.
5. Players earn **10 points** for each valid word submission.
6. The game continues indefinitely until players decide to stop.
